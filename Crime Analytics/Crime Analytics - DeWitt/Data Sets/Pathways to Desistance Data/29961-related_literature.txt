In addressing this issue, the project recognized the need for prospective
research on serious juvenile offenders that will determine both the
prevalence and impact of continuous exposure to violence in multiple
settings that inflicts re-traumatization, leading to reoffending. In this
effort secondary analysis was conducted on data from the Pathways to
Desistance Study (Mulvey, 2004). The findings indicate that juvenile
offenders are exposed to disproportionately high levels of community
violence, as well as violence exposure in correctional and residential
settings. This indicates the need for policies and practices that support
trauma-informed care and services that mitigate the impact of violence
exposure on thoughts and behaviors. This suggests the need for universal
screening that will identify trauma exposure and trauma-related
impairments. Such screening should be done when youth enter the juvenile
justice system. Trauma-responsive treatment should be made available in
both community-based settings and in juvenile detention/correctional
facilities. Evaluation research is also needed to determine the long-term
effects of such treatment on trauma exposure, trauma-related impairment,
re-offending, and re-arrest. The findings on the levels of violence
exposure in correctional settings and residential settings indicate the
need for staff training on how trauma-informed practices must be used in
interactions with and the management of juvenile residents. 4 tables, 1

The study examined the link between a youth’s exposure to violence and
various types of psychological symptoms. The strongest link was found
between exposure to violence and depression, hostility, paranoid ideation,
and psychotic symptoms. Associations between the level and trajectories of
exposure to violence and psychological distress remained consistent over
the study period. The findings indicated a general decrease in exposure to
violence and psychological distress over time; however, the findings do not
support the belief that exposure to violence and psychological distress
improve or worsen similarly for all justice-involved youth. Although
Caucasian and Hispanic youth generally showed a significant decrease in
exposure to violence, this did not occur among African-American youth. The
study involved a sample of 1,354 male and female youths, who completed a
baseline assessment and 10 follow-up interviews over a 7-year period as
part of the Pathways to Desistence study. After descriptive and bivariate
analyses, latent class analysis identified a taxonomy based on adolescents’
patterns of exposure to violence; and the association between the exposure
to violence and various psychological symptoms. In addition, latent growth
models were used to examine changes in exposure to violence over time;
changes in psychological distress over time; parallel processes of change
in exposure to violence and psychological distress over time; and
differences in the evolution of violence exposure and psychological
distress across gender and race/ethnicity. Implications are drawn for those
who treat justice-involved youth, and recommendations are provided for
future related research. 5 tables, 1 figure, and 44 references

The study examined the link between a youth’s exposure to violence and
various types of psychological symptoms. The strongest link was found
between exposure to violence and depression, hostility, paranoid ideation,
and psychotic symptoms. Associations between the level and trajectories of
exposure to violence and psychological distress remained consistent over
the study period. The findings indicated a general decrease in exposure to
violence and psychological distress over time; however, the findings do not

Findings indicate that desistance from crime has occurred among the youth
studied. As a whole, the sample has moved from more frequent and varied
crimes to committing crimes less often of a less serious nature. Not all of
the offenders with reduced rates of arrest quit offending (Some self-
reported continued offending); however, the general pattern was a reduction
in both self-reported offending and arrests. Analyses thus far have
identified at least two factors that are apparently related to later
offending patterns and outcome, i.e., substance use and intra-psychic
change (shifts in attitude about offending and the legal system, as well as
gains in psychosocial maturity). This suggests the importance of developing
methods that accelerate mature thinking about what youth want in life and
how to achieve it. Suggestions are offered on how to promote interventions
that address these two factors linked to outcomes for serious adolescent
offenders. The study began data collection in November 2000 and completed
the last follow-up interview in April 2010. The study baseline and follow-
up interviews addressed six domains: indicators of individual functioning,
psychosocial development and attitudes, family context, personal
relationships, community context, and a monthly account of changes in
multiple domains. The monthly data permit an analysis of the nature,
number, and timing of important changes in life circumstances. More detail
about the Pathways study design, methods, and measures can be found on the
study Web site (www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu.). Tables and references

Findings show a decrease in self-reported offending over time by the most
serious adolescent offenders, the relative inefficacy of longer juvenile
incarcerations in decreasing recidivism, the effectiveness of community-
based supervision as a component of aftercare for incarcerated youth, and
the effectiveness of substance abuse treatment in reducing both substance
use and offending by serious adolescent offenders. Most youth who commit
felonies greatly reduce their offending over time regardless of the
intervention. Longer stays in juvenile institutions do not reduce
recidivism and institutional placement may even raise offending levels in
those with the lowest level of offending; in the period after
incarceration, community-based supervision is effective for youth who have
committed serious offenses; and substance abuse treatment reduces both
substance use and criminal offending for a limited time. Only a small
proportion of the offenders studied continued to offend at a high level
throughout the follow-up period. Finally, substance use is a major factor
in continued criminal activity by serious adolescent offenders. Substance
abuse treatment for young offenders reduces both substance use and nondrug-
related offending in the short term, if the treatment period is long enough
and if families take part in the treatment with the offender. 1 figure, 2

This research compares the standing literature with findings from the
Pathways study and discusses the possible implications of these findings
for future changes in transfer statutes. Results suggest that adolescents
in the adult system may be at risk for disruptions in their personal
development, identity formation, relationships, learning, growth in skills
and competencies, and positive movement into adult status; that most of the
youth in the study who were sent to adult facilities returned to the
community within a few years, varying widely in their levels of adjustment;
that youth were more likely to successfully adjust when they were not
influenced by antisocial peers; and that transferred youth are more likely
to commit criminal acts than adolescents kept in the juvenile justice
system. Findings from the Pathways study also indicate that transfer may
have a differential effect (either reducing or increasing offending),
depending on the juvenileâs presenting offense and prior offense history.

Selected findings from the study include the following: adolescent
offenders with behavioral health problems, excluding substance abuse were
at no greater risk of re-arrest or engaging in antisocial activities than
young offenders without these problems; study participants with substance
use disorders had more negative outcomes and fewer positive outcomes; a
substantial percentage of youth with diagnosable mental health and
substance use problems did not receive services in residential settings,
while even fewer reported receiving community-based services; and more
frequent aftercare services significantly reduced the odds of an arrest or
return to an institution during the 6-month aftercare period with each
added month of services reducing the odds for these outcomes by 12 percent.
The Pathways to Desistance study is a multidisciplinary, multisite
longitudinal study investigating how serious juvenile offenders make the
transition from adolescence to adulthood. The study follows 1,354 youth
from 2 major metropolitan areas for 7 years following their court
involvement. This bulletin first presents background information on the
prevalence of behavioral health problems among serious juvenile offenders,
and the benefits of providing mental health treatment for them. This is
followed by a discussion of how the Pathways to Desistance study assesses
behavioral health problems and criminogenic risk among this group of
juveniles, and the negative and positive outcomes for these youth, such as
re-arrest and participation in antisocial activity. The findings from the
study indicate the need for improving serious juvenile offenders’ access to
mental health treatment and services. Implications for juvenile justice
policy and practice are discussed. Figure, endnotes, and references
