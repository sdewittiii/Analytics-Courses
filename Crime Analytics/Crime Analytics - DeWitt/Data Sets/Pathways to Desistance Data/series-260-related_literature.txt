Findings indicate that desistance from crime has occurred among the youth
studied. As a whole, the sample has moved from more frequent and varied
crimes to committing crimes less often of a less serious nature. Not all of
the offenders with reduced rates of arrest quit offending (Some self-
reported continued offending); however, the general pattern was a reduction
in both self-reported offending and arrests. Analyses thus far have
identified at least two factors that are apparently related to later
offending patterns and outcome, i.e., substance use and intra-psychic
change (shifts in attitude about offending and the legal system, as well as
gains in psychosocial maturity). This suggests the importance of developing
methods that accelerate mature thinking about what youth want in life and
how to achieve it. Suggestions are offered on how to promote interventions
that address these two factors linked to outcomes for serious adolescent
offenders. The study began data collection in November 2000 and completed
the last follow-up interview in April 2010. The study baseline and follow-
up interviews addressed six domains: indicators of individual functioning,
psychosocial development and attitudes, family context, personal
relationships, community context, and a monthly account of changes in
multiple domains. The monthly data permit an analysis of the nature,
number, and timing of important changes in life circumstances. More detail
about the Pathways study design, methods, and measures can be found on the
study Web site (www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu.). Tables and references

This research compares the standing literature with findings from the
Pathways study and discusses the possible implications of these findings
for future changes in transfer statutes. Results suggest that adolescents
in the adult system may be at risk for disruptions in their personal
development, identity formation, relationships, learning, growth in skills
and competencies, and positive movement into adult status; that most of the
youth in the study who were sent to adult facilities returned to the
community within a few years, varying widely in their levels of adjustment;
that youth were more likely to successfully adjust when they were not
influenced by antisocial peers; and that transferred youth are more likely
to commit criminal acts than adolescents kept in the juvenile justice
system. Findings from the Pathways study also indicate that transfer may
have a differential effect (either reducing or increasing offending),
depending on the juvenile’s presenting offense and prior offense history.

Selected findings from the study include the following: adolescent
offenders with behavioral health problems, excluding substance abuse were
at no greater risk of re-arrest or engaging in antisocial activities than
young offenders without these problems; study participants with substance
use disorders had more negative outcomes and fewer positive outcomes; a
substantial percentage of youth with diagnosable mental health and
substance use problems did not receive services in residential settings,
while even fewer reported receiving community-based services; and more
frequent aftercare services significantly reduced the odds of an arrest or
return to an institution during the 6-month aftercare period with each
added month of services reducing the odds for these outcomes by 12 percent.
The Pathways to Desistance study is a multidisciplinary, multisite
longitudinal study investigating how serious juvenile offenders make the
transition from adolescence to adulthood. The study follows 1,354 youth
from 2 major metropolitan areas for 7 years following their court
involvement. This bulletin first presents background information on the
prevalence of behavioral health problems among serious juvenile offenders,
and the benefits of providing mental health treatment for them. This is
followed by a discussion of how the Pathways to Desistance study assesses
behavioral health problems and criminogenic risk among this group of
juveniles, and the negative and positive outcomes for these youth, such as
re-arrest and participation in antisocial activity. The findings from the
study indicate the need for improving serious juvenile offenders’ access to
mental health treatment and services. Implications for juvenile justice
policy and practice are discussed. Figure, endnotes, and references

Selected findings from the study include the following: adolescent
offenders with behavioral health problems, excluding substance abuse were
at no greater risk of re-arrest or engaging in antisocial activities than
young offenders without these problems; study participants with substance
use disorders had more negative outcomes and fewer positive outcomes; a
substantial percentage of youth with diagnosable mental health and
substance use problems did not receive services in residential settings,
while even fewer reported receiving community-based services; and more
frequent aftercare services significantly reduced the odds of an arrest or
return to an institution during the 6-month aftercare period with each
added month of services reducing the odds for these outcomes by 12 percent.
The Pathways to Desistance study is a multidisciplinary, multisite
longitudinal study investigating how serious juvenile offenders make the
transition from adolescence to adulthood. The study follows 1,354 youth
from 2 major metropolitan areas for 7 years following their court
involvement. This bulletin first presents background information on the
prevalence of behavioral health problems among serious juvenile offenders,
and the benefits of providing mental health treatment for them. This is
followed by a discussion of how the Pathways to Desistance study assesses
behavioral health problems and criminogenic risk among this group of
juveniles, and the negative and positive outcomes for these youth, such as
re-arrest and participation in antisocial activity. The findings from the
study indicate the need for improving serious juvenile offenders’ access to
mental health treatment and services. Implications for juvenile justice
policy and practice are discussed. Figure, endnotes, and references
