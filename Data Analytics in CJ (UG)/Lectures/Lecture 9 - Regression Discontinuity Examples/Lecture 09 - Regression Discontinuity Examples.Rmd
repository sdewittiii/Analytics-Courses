## Regression Discontinuity Examples

1) Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) - Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA)
2) Crost and Rees (2013) - New Estimates
3) Yoruk and Yoruk (2013) - Revision

## Why is 21 the legal drinking age in the US?

- Most states voluntarily set age at 21 until the 1970s
- Some states lowered the MLDA during the 1970s to as low as 18
- Drunk driving and traffic fatalities became prominent issues in early 1980s
- Reagan signs National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984

## What is the Effect of MLDA?

- We *think*...:
  - Higher MLDA reduces drunk driving and traffic fatalities
  - Higher MLDA reduces teen drinking (but does not preclude it)
  - Higher MLDA reduces teen smoking (tobacco and marijuana)
  
\vspace{6pt}

- We *know* that...
  - These impacts were largely driven by early-adoption states of 21 as MLDA
  
## Complications for Causal Effects

- How we try to estimate causal effects of laws
  - We assume individual-level behavior is not a cause of law, but a consequence
  - This can result in **exogeneity** in the relationship between law and behavior
  - We can then capitalize on cross-state differences in the type and timing MLDA laws
  
\vspace{6pt}
  
- Is MLDA exogenous? 
  - Probably not - Law is not unrelated to teen drinking behavior
  
## Does MLDA Have a True Causal Effect on Smoking?

Yoruk and Yoruk (2011)

- Use age as a running variable to estimate within-person causal effect
  - I.e., what is the effect of being able to consume alcohol legally on smoking behaviors?
  
\vspace{6pt}
  
- Measure of age
  - Obtained exact birth and interview dates (public data gives you month at best)
  - Calculated the numbers of days pre/post turning 21 as of the date of the latest NLSY97 interview
  
## Does MLDA Have a True Causal Effect on Smoking? (cont)

- Age bandwidths (multiple)
  - 480 days
  - 240 days
  - 120 days
  - 60 days
  - 30 days
  
\vspace{6pt}
  
- Estimation
  - Local linear regressions above/below bandwidth
    - This just means the regressions are estimated right below and above the cutoffs according to the chosen bandwidths. 
    
## Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) - Covariate Balance

## Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) - Covariate Balance

Just a slide for listing what I say about Table 1

- Ignore significance of constant coefficient - this is mainly indicating a consistent estimate of where the line crosses the y-axis

- Most importantly - no covariates appear to be imbalanced around the 21st birthday cutoff

- This is largely expected - birthdate is not something people will try to manipulate for the purposes of a survey

- However, this does not imply that youth do not try to manipulate their apparent age to get access to alcohol!

## Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) - Effect of MLDA on Alcohol Consumption

\includegraphics[scale=.50]{yoruk_table2.png}

## Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) - Effect of MLDA on Alcohol Consumption

Another slide for listing what I say about Table 2

- Underlying question being tested is if the MLDA has an effect on alcohol use above/below the cutoffs with bandwidth of 240 days.

- Results are about what we would expect:
  - Use of alcohol (binary) increases
  - Binge drinking (binary) also increases
  - Days using alcohol increases along with days of binge drinking
  - No effect on number of total drinks consumed, though
  
## Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) - Effect of MLDA on Smoking Habits

\includegraphics[scale=.50]{yoruk_table3.png}

## Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) - Effect of MLDA on Smoking Habits

Another slide for listing what I say about Table 3

- Question being tested is whether legal access to alcohol also affects smoking (tobacco/marijuana) habits

- Results are a little strange
  - No effect on probability of smoking tobacco or amount, for that matter
  - About a 7\% increase in the probability of using marijuana
  
Seems to contradict anecdotal evidence re:amplification of tobacco use and the alternative interpretation of marijuana being the *gateway* drug. 

## Crost and Rees (2013) - Why It Is Important to Read Data Codebooks Carefully

The evidence from Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) was somewhat surprising, but Crost and Rees (2013) provide a good explanation for why the original results were somewhat counterintuitive. 

- Some markers for why it looked like something was wrong:
  - Reported marijuana use in the past 30 days in Yoruk and Yoruk was **very** high (76\%!!!)
  - Sample drops precipitously in marijuana discontinuity model (about 20,000 observations lost)
  
From this, Crost and Rees (2013) surmise that Yoruk and Yoruk (2011) ignored an important lead-in question. In fact, they accidentally restricted their sample only to those that used marijuana since the last survey!

## Crost and Rees (2013) - Corrected Findings

\end{center}

## Crost and Rees (2013) - Corrected Findings

Another slide for listing what I say about Table 1 from Crost and Rees (2013)

- Conditional estimates are only for youth who **have** used marijuana since the last interview

- Unconditional estimates are for all youth regardless of prior marijuana use

- What changes?
  - The 6-7\% increase in marijuana use in the past 30 days disappears!
  
## Crost and Rees (2013) - Corrected Findings (Figure)

## Crost and Rees (2013) - Corrected Findings (Figure)

So, are alcohol and marijuana use interdependent?

- Kind of....but not in the way Yoruk and Yoruk thought of it
  - MLDA does not have an impact on the **probability** of using marijuana at all
  - MLDA does **look like** it may have an impact on the recency of using marijuana **if** you have used marijuana before

## Yoruk and Yoruk (2013) - Revised Estimates

Yoruk and Yoruk (2013) is a response to Crost and Rees (2013) and re-reports revised findings for all of the hypotheses tested in their original study.

- As an aside, I chose this series of papers because:
  - I figured you might be interested in MLDA laws given your average ages
  - It's a good example of a collegial back and forth where incorrect scientific evidence is corrected (this is an example of science working properly!)
  - A reminder not to take scientific evidence at face value but also not to dismiss it entirely.
    - It's important to be skeptical of **surprising** findings - sometimes there's a good reason for this
    
## Yoruk and Yoruk (2013) - Revised Estimates
    
\includegraphics[scale=.50]{yoruk2013_table1.png}

## Yoruk and Yoruk (2013) - Revised Estimates

- So, a brief conclusion:
  - MLDA has a clear impact on the probability and frequency of alcohol use (as anticipated)
  - But, it does not have an impact on the probability and frequency of smoking or marijuana use in the unconditional samples
    - Its effect on marijuana use may be conditional though
