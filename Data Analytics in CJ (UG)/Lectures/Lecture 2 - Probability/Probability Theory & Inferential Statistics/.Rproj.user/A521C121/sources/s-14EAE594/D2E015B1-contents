## RStudio - What is it?

RStudio is a UI overlay for the base R package, which is an open-source statistical program. 

R is quickly becoming a *very* popular programming language due to its:

1) Versatility (lots **can** be done in R - does *not* necessarily mean you should, though)
2) It's free!
3) That's basically it - \#2 is pretty big for government agencies (stats programs like SPSS, SAS, or Stata are hard on budgets)

In turn, RStudio is a popular overlay because:

1) It makes R look more like other popular stats programs
2) It allows for many functions to be completed through point-and-click (I highly advise against this!)

## How to Install R and & RStudio on your Home PC

First step - install R

1) Navigate to http://rweb.crmda.ku.edu/cran/
2) Select the R download for your OS (Linux, Mac, or Windows)
3) Download and run the installer (default install options are appropriate for most users)

Second step - install RStudio

1) Navigate to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
2) Select the RStudio download for your OS (Linuc, Mac, or Windows)
3) Download and run the installer (default install options are appropriate for most users)

Third step - there isn't one. Just open the program (RStudio) now. 

## Introduction to the NLSY97

The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) is the data set we will become familiarized with over the course of this semester. 

It includes data on nearly 9000 US youth ages 12 to 16 as of 1997 and has been following them ever since. 

The additional readings you have for this course *all* use the NLSY97, and all of your programming assignments and exams will also use this data set. 

Simply stated, prepare to become quite familiar with these data over the semester.

## Where Do I Get Data From the NLSY97?

The data set is conveniently located here - https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/search.jsp?s=NLSY97

The 'Investigator' webpage allows you to select the variable you want, then export the data in a specified format. 

**Most** variables are measured on a semi-yearly basis for the beginning years of the survey. Interviews *generally* occurred once a year, so most questions asked of these youth are "since the date of the last interview (DLI)"

I'll give you a tour of the Investigator now, and show you how I select the variables I use for this introduction. 

## Now What Do I Do With The Data?

We've downloaded the data in our desired format, now what?

Well, we need to import it into RStudio (pretty simple) and then *clean* the data (not at all simple). 

Importing the data can be accomplished with code (you should do it this way) or through point-and-click menus (you should not use this method!). 

## Importing Data into RStudio

They have made this quite simple. After you download the data and unzip the file, simply open the inclded R file. 

At the very top of this file is a line of code for setting your working directory.

1) Uncomment that line (i.e., remove the \#) and then write the path to your extracted .csv file. 
2) Run the entire list of commands (ctrl+A then ctrl+D).
3) Sit back and watch (cross your fingers for no errors to appear). 

## A Quick Reminder on File Paths in R

Remember that the backslash ("\\") is an *escape* character in R - you'll need to escape each backslash in the file path if you are using Windows.

So, the following file path: "C:\\Users\\yourid\\etc..." will **not** work and you'll get an error. 

Instead, use the following path: "C:\\\\Users\\\\yourid\\\\etc..." and you will avoid that error. 

Alternatively, you could also replace all backslashes (\\) in the file path with forward slashes (/) - up to you. 

## Back to Regularly Scheduled Programming

\center \huge Get it, because I'm a college professor mind-programming my students....

## The Data is In RStudio, Now What?

Now, we will begin to explore a few common functions you will need to use throughout the semester. 

1) Getting help: ? and ??
2) Installing new packages: install.packages()
3) Loading packages: library()
4) Setting a working directory: setwd() (and getwd())
5) Creating a data frame: data.frame()
6) Summarizing a vector or data frame: summary()
7) The concatenate command: c()
8) The basic plot command: plot()
9) A more advanced plot command suite: ggplot2
10) Recoding values of a pre-existing variable: (also the use of if and else)
